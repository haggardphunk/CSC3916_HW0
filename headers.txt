describe each key value pair in the HTTP header in both request and response
and check it in with the project to GitHub (e.g. what is the content-type and
what does it mean?)

The request header, "PostmanRuntime/7.26.10", This is to be used in an HTTP request to provide information about the request context
The accept header indicates what formats are preferred for the response
The token indicates that I obtained approval when the connection was made.
Host is the domain that serves the API, in this case Google API's
The Accept-Encoding tells the server what it supports
And the Connection determines whether or not to drop the connection or how long to keep it open.


RESPONSES
-"The Content-Type entity header is used to indicate the media type of the resource"
-The Vary HTTP response header determines how to match future request headers to decide whether
a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server
-The Content-Encoding entity header is used to compress the media-type
-Cache-Control: private. Indicates that all or part of the response message is intended for a single user and MUST NOT be cached by a shared cache
-With chunked transfer encoding (CTE), the encoder sends data to the player in a series of chunks instead of waiting until the complete segment is available.
